The only reason it is worth trying to write a CV in markdown is so it can be generated in both HTML and PDF formats. This is dumb and it makes tweaking things really tedious. I should just make my CV in HTML and use something written in javascript to try to generation a PDF from the HTML rather than from the markdown.
